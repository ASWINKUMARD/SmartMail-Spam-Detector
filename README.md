# SmartMail-Spam-Detector
Multinomial Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm used in NLP for text classification, such as spam detection. It calculates the probability of a message being “spam” or “not spam” based on word frequencies. Trained on labeled emails, it efficiently predicts spam by comparing word likelihoods across both categories.
