# 📧 SmartMail Spam Detector

# 🧠 About the Project

- SmartMail Spam Detector is a simple NLP project that uses Multinomial Naive Bayes to classify messages as Spam or Not Spam.
- It learns from word patterns in text data and predicts whether a message is unwanted spam or a normal one.

# ⚙️ What It Does

✅ Cleans and preprocesses text

✅ Extracts features using Bag of Words / TF-IDF

✅ Trains a Naive Bayes classifier

✅ Predicts spam instantly

✅ Shows accuracy and performance metrics

# 🏗️ Project Workflow

1️⃣ Data Collection – Load labeled messages (spam/ham)

2️⃣ Text Preprocessing – Tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming

3️⃣ Feature Extraction – Convert text into vectors using CountVectorizer or TF-IDF

4️⃣ Model Training – Apply Multinomial Naive Bayes

5️⃣ Evaluation – Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

6️⃣ Prediction – Input your own messages and test results 🎉
